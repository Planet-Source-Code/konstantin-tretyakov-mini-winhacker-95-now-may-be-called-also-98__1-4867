## Mini WinHacker 95   \(now may be called also 98\)


</div>

### Description

On the whole this program was written under the impression of the

WinHack (v1 beta) (I am sorry for taking the name, I do not

claim to have the trademark) by Wedge Software.

I also added the "Window Manager" feature to it.

I think it may be useful to anyone:

--If you are not a programmer, then you may use it's features.

--If you are a not advanced programmer then you will know:

-What are some interesting Registry Keys

(e.g how to change system user's name and organization)

-How to create a 'Control Panel' folder, etc

(thus, for instance, you may have any number of Recycle Bins

on your Desktop)

-How to use the registry

-How to work with windows

-How to reboot the computer (though this code is commented out)

-Many other stuff on general VB programming

-Please, read the README.TXT file, supplied with the ZIP
