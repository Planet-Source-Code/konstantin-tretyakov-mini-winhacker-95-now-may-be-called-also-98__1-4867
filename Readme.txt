On the whole: Remember, it is NOT FAIR to write your name

(It took me about a WEEK to make it !!! (I was quite 'young' at VB at that time))

I would appreciate, if you mail me your program

About the program

The code must seem obvious, only there are lots of code commented out 
That is because, when I was making it, I knew nothing about APIs and
I wanted to study them, in fact, I was making this program to study
API functions. I had no documentation on it, only the WinApi.txt, supplied
with VB5, so I just tried all the functions, which names I liked, and 
watched the results. That's why lots of code is commented out here.

On the whole this program was written under the impression of the
WinHack (v1 beta) (I am sorry for taking the name, I do not
claim to have the trademark) by Wedge Software.
-Btw, how did I find out what was this Winhack doing ?
-Easy and stupid. I saved my registry, then changed all the settings
in Winhack, then saved the registry again and compared the files.

Last remarks:

Well, I think it may be useful to anyone:
--If you are not a programmer, then you may use it's features.
--If you are a not advanced programmer then you will know:
   -What are some interesting Registry Keys
    (e.g how to change system user's name and organization)
   -How to create a 'Control Panel' folder, etc
    (thus, for instance, you may have any number of Recycle Bins 
                     on your Desktop)
   -How to use the registry
   -How to work with windows
   -How to reboot the computer (though this code is commented out)
   -Many other stuff on general VB programming
